    "## 1. Switching Chain ##\n",
    "Consider a Markov Chain $X_0, X_1, \\ldots$ with the transition matrix given below, for some $0 < p < 1$ and $q = 1-p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "| **States**| $~~0~~$ | $~~1~~$ |\n",
    "|-----|-----|-----|\n",

    "**a)** Explain why this chain is irreducible and aperiodic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** For $n \\ge 1$, let $C_n$ be the number of *switches* up to time $n$. That is, $C_n$ is the number of times the chain changes state up to and including time $n$. For example, if the path is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1, then $C_8 = 3$ (remember that the path starts at $X_0$). What is the distribution of $C_n$, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** In the path $010100$, $X_0 = 0$ and $X_5 = 0$, so there is a $0 \\to 0$ transition in 5 steps. Find the value of $C_5$ for this path; you don't have to turn it in. For your own understanding, create several more examples of $0 \\to 0$ transitions for different values of $n$, and find the value of $C_n$ in each of your examples. There are already some more examples in the given path $010100$. For example the initial segment $010$ is a $0 \\to 0$ transition in 2 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about what is common to the values of $C_n$ that you found in your examples. Now fill in the blank with a word, and **justify your answer**. \n",

    "**d)** Now find $P_n(0, 0)$ using Part **b**. [Hint: Compare the expansions of $(p+q)^n$ and $(p-q)^n$. How can you use both of them to get just the terms that you need?] \n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** Use Part **d** (not the balance equations) to find the stationary distribution of the chain. This will give you a complete proof of the stationary distribution in this case, whereas our general discussion of the balance equations relies on your acceptance of the main [convergence theorem](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_10/03_Long_Run_Behavior.html#convergence-to-stationarity) without proof."

    "\n",
    "**b)** Suppose that yesterday Panda arrived at the front door and was not disappointed. What is the chance of the same thing happening today? What is your best guess for the chance of the same thing happening (Panda arriving at the front door and not being disappointed) one year from now, assuming that the process continues as described?\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** Panda's strategy is to remember where the food was the previous day, and go to that door. Here are three other strategies that Panda might use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always go to the front door.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always go to the back door.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember where the food was the previous day, and go to the other door.\n",
