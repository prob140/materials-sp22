I've picked problems that are not near-clones of what you've already done in homework etc this term. Use these for practice, but expect that the lengths of the problems on your midterm will be more like Problems 7-12.\n",
    "- **Don't start Problems 7-12 early.** Those were the problems my most recent on-paper in-class 75 minute midterm just like yours. Use these as an opportunity to assess your preparation for the upcoming midterm. First complete the bulk of your review for the exam, and do 1-6. **After that, set aside all course materials, find a place where you can work on your own, and give yourself 75 minutes to do the problems.** The problems that you are not able to do in that time will give you an indication of where you need to focus the remaining portion of your review."
