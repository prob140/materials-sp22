    "In this lab, you have learned:\n",
    "- How to work with the `MarkovChain` class in the `prob140` library\n",
    "- Repeating the random-to-front shuffle leads to a well shuffled deck\n",
    "- Books in the Tsetlin Library are found in the leftmost position according to their \"importance\" as measured by their assigned weights\n",
    "- Among the times when a particular book is on the left, the proportions of times the other books are second from left have the same ratios as the weights of those books\n",
    "- Markov chains on permutations (both random and size-biased as in the Tsetlin Library) have symmetries that can lead to remarkable long run properties."

    "## Submission Instructions ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Many assignments throughout the course will have a written portion and a code portion. Please follow the directions below to properly submit both portions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Written Portion ###\n",
    "*  Scan all the pages into a PDF. You can use any scanner or a phone using applications such as CamScanner. Please **DO NOT** simply take pictures using your phone. \n",
    "* Please start a new page for each question. If you have already written multiple questions on the same page, you can crop the image in CamScanner or fold your page over (the old-fashioned way). This helps expedite grading.\n",
    "* It is your responsibility to check that all the work on all the scanned pages is legible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Portion ###\n",
    "* Save your notebook using File > Save and Checkpoint.\n",
    "* Generate a PDF file using File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX. This might take a few seconds and will automatically download a PDF version of this notebook.\n",
    "    * If you have issues, please make a follow-up post on the general Lab 2 Ed thread.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Submitting ###\n",
    "* Combine the PDFs from the written and code portions into one PDF.  [Here](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) is a useful tool for doing so. \n",
    "* Submit the assignment to Lab 2 on Gradescope. \n",
    "* **Make sure to assign each page of your pdf to the correct question.**\n",
    "* **It is your responsibility to verify that all of your work shows up in your final PDF submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have questions about scanning or uploading your work, please post a follow-up to the [Ed thread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/17989/discussion/1027297) on this topic. "
